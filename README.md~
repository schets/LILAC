LILAC: Learning and Integration of Lasers for Adaptive Control

This project provides a framework with which to analyze/control lasers, and more generally, any tunable dynamical system.

You can find documentation on the [wiki](http://github.com/schets/LILAC/wiki), and doxygen generated [advanced documentation](http://schets.github.io/LILAC) as well 

Installation:
This project depends on [GCC](gcc.gnu.org, [Git](git-scm.com) and [FFTW](www.fftw.org) These are simple to install on Linux and Macintosh systems and each site provides installation instructions. GSL will likely be dropped as a requirement in the future, but for now it useful functions and allows more time to focus on the actual engine. The Egien BLAS library is included in the project, to simplify installing on the NERSC systems. Eigen, along with documentation, can be found at eigen.tuxfamily.org

On Linux:

1. From the command line, proceed to the directory in which you want to have lilac installed.
2. Run the command: git clone https://github.com/schets/LILAC lilac
3. Enter the lilac directory (cd lilac)
4. Compile the code by running make
5. Upon successful compilation, the lilac binary can be found in the directory bin

Or, from to installation directory, copy and paste this into the command line

git clone https://github.com/schets/LILAC lilac && cd lilac && make
